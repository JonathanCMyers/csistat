# csistat
Analysis of data for the Baylor University Computer Science Department on the retention rate of students in the computer science department. The data was initially collected through a mandatory CSI 1095 course for freshman/transfer computer science majors through a web form they were given the link to. A follow-up survey was conducted several weeks later, after the students had the opportunity to be exposed to more challenging computer science topics, and several computer science exams.  
  

These web forms are both entitled index.php.  
  
The initial survey is in **csistat**, and the follow-up survey is in **csistat2**  
  
The data from this web form is sent to a database, which is where it is analyzed.
